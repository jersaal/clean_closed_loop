Hello!

1st, update the config.yml file. It's important to ensure that 'channel' and 'inlet name' are selected properly.
    'Channel' is the label of the channel that will be used for closed loop. Distal hippocampal lead preferred
    'inlet name' is the name of the LSL stream sending out sEEG data

2nd, If you haven't already, start the LSL Seeg stream.

3rd, Run decoder4.py
    When prompted, enter a patient identifier. Keep the identifier in mind. This will create a folder on C:/
    It will start collected baseline data for a total of two minutes. During this period, you can move on to the next step
    Keep an eye out for errors in the python window

4th, run 'Linear' in the English_CL_Build folder. Choose the appropriate resolution, full screen, and 'fastest' as the settings
    IMPORTANT: Enter the same patient ID that you did you for the python file.
    First, instructions will be displayed. Try to make sure that patient understand them.
    You will not be able to move past the second instruction page until baseline data as been collected.
        At this point a green '*' will appear at the top right of the screen, and you can press space to start the study

5th, let the study run
    One the task finishes, it will let you know. Press space to exit the task.
	If the patient is getting close to zero bursts, you can try reducing the 'powerThreshPercentile' in config.yml and reset the study. Try bringing it down by .2 or .3.
    If they patient is constantly and overwhelmingly moving forward, try increasing the 'powerThreshPercentile' by .2 or .3

6th, Exit the decoder
    Keep "spamming" q until it quits. This could take a few tens of seconds.

And that's it!!!! Thanks so much
